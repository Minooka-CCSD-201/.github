# Hi there 👋

This is the home of the Minooka CCSD 201 coding library. There is lots of fun stuff on here that we use to solve problems.

## Contribution Guidelines ❗
We want to ensure that our code base is accurate to what is in production. To help with that, we'll use this high-level structure for contributing:
1. 🍴 Fork the repository you want to work on. This gives your personal account a copy of it
2. 🌳 Clone, create a new branch, set up your environment and commit your changes.
3. 📋 Create a pull request, which the changes will go through a review process.
As a note: Make sure to always sync the forked repository with the base one to stay up to date if necessary.

🔨 We are still hammering out more of the details surrounding this. It will be a constant work in progress, but we hope that this can allow us to have a nice way to store our code and open it up for collaboartion.

📓 Check out the [Minooka 201 Documentation Repo](https://github.com/Minooka-CCSD-201/min201-documentation) for information about various things we use.
